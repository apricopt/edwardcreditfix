            agency must be obtained directly from such credit reporting agency.
            The credit reports provided or requested through the Website or

          </p>

          <h4>24. DISPUTES; ARBITRATION.</h4>
          <p>
            EXCEPT AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING ALL
            RIGHTS TO: (A) A TRIAL BY JURY; (B) PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
            LAWSUIT OR CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION; AND (C) BRING AN ACTION AGAINST
            US IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU MAY INDIVIDUALLY ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM
            AGAINST US IN ANY JURISDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU AGREE THAT
            ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN
            INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE
            ACTION.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any Claim relating to the use of the Website and Services and/or in
            your requesting us to contact you about Services, is governed by the
            laws of the state of Nevada. A &ldquo;Claim&rdquo; is any case,
            controversy, dispute, tort, disagreement, lawsuit, legal action, or
            claim now or hereafter pending between you and us, including but not
            limited to any alleged state or federal statutory violation, or any
            dispute over the interpretation of the Terms of Use or the
            arbitrability of any Claim pursuant to the Terms of Use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any Claim now or hereafter pending between you and us relating in
            any way to your use of the Website or any Services shall be resolved
            by binding arbitration as described in this section, rather than in
            court, except that (i) you may assert claims in a small claims court
            located in the state of Nevada if your claims qualify and (ii) you
            or we may bring suit in any state or Federal court in Nevada,
            submitting to the jurisdiction of such court and waiving our
            respective rights to any other jurisdiction, to enjoin infringement
            or other misuse of intellectual property rights. The parties
            understand and agree that either party may bring claims against the
            other only in his/her or its individual capacity and not as a class
            member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further,
            the parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate
            proceedings of more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
            preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. There
            is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
            arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
            individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
            injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must
            follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. To
            begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
            arbitration and describing your claim to Creditfix.com, Attn:
            Business &amp; Legal Affairs; compliance@creditfix.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
            Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary
            Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. Payment of all filing,
            administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's
            rules. You agree that the Terms of Use involves commerce under 9
            U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1 et seq. and that this arbitration clause is
            governed by Federal law, including the Federal Arbitration Act. We
            will not seek attorneys' fees and costs from you in arbitration
            unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may
            choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
            written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at
            another mutually agreed location. If for any reason a claim proceeds
            in court rather than in arbitration, we and you each waive any right
            to a jury trial, and such claims shall be brought
            <u>exclusively</u> in the state or Federal courts of Nevada.
          </p>

          <h4>25. GENERAL PROVISIONS.</h4>
          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms of Use are held to be invalid or
            unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining
            provisions shall be enforced. You agree that these Terms of Use and
            all incorporated agreements, including membership and other related
            client agreements, may be automatically assigned by us in our sole
            discretion. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way
            define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such
            section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or
            others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or
            similar breaches. You agree that any cause of action arising out of
            or related to the Website, Services or these Terms of Use must
            commence within one year after the cause of action arose; otherwise,
            such cause of action is permanently barred. All provisions in these
            Terms of Use regarding representations and warranties,
            indemnification, disclaimers, and limitation of liability will
            survive the termination of this Agreement. If any provision of these
            Terms of Use are in conflict with any term or condition as set forth
            in a membership or other client related agreement, the terms and
            conditions of the membership or client related agreements shall
            control.
